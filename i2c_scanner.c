//I2C_MasterWrite_CheckACK
/* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ */
/* modified function for I2C Master to send data and returns I2C error
 * is being used from i2C_scanner to detect whether a specific slave responds
 * with an ACK
 *
 * Parameters:
 * 			*i2c:		I2C base address of used I2C module
 * 			addr:		i2C slave address to be communicated / checked
 * Returns:
 * 			0: 			no Ack found
 * 			1: 			slave sent Ack
 *
 *  Interrupt Flag Register 0 bit 7:
 *  Address ACK from External Slave Interrupt Flag
 *  This field is set when a slave address ACK is received.
 *  Write 1 to clear. Write 0 has no effect.
 *  0: Condition has not occurred.
 *  1: The slave device ACK for the address was received
 *
 * Interrupt Flag Register 0 bit 10:
 *  Address NACK from Slave Error Flag
 *  This flag is set by hardware if an Address NACK is received from a slave on the I2C bus.
 *  This flag is only valid if the I2Cn peripheral is configured for Master Mode operation.
 *  Write 1 to clear. Write 0 has no effect.
 *  0: Error condition has not occurred.
 *  1: Address NACK received from a slave
 *
 * Interrupt Flag Register 0 bit 7 (ACK) is being used to detect attached I2C device.
